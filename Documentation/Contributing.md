# Contributing

## Spirit
Builder Is intended to be a sandbox tool for creating and playing with FRC robots

## Liscence
Builder is GPL V3.0 liscensed. This means any changes you share MUST have their code made available publicly, and you are Highly encouraged to contribute back to the base repo

## Builder Isn't meant to be Built
The project in its current state SHOULD NEVER BE BUILT into a `.exe`. The purpose is to be an easy-to-use toolbox for tinkering and creating robots. Creating a build goes against this. Builder is also not set up to be used as a dedicated Game Source code and as such will be buggy and low quality.
